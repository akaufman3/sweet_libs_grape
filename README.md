# Ruby Grape

"An opinionated micro-framework for creating REST-like APIs in Ruby."

"...designed to run on Rack or complement web application framework such as Rails and Sinatra by providing a simple DSL..."

"...built in support for common conventions: multiple formats, subdomain/prefix restriction, content negotiation, versioning..."

## Vocabulary

* REST => any simple URI-based request to a specific domain over HTTP without the use of an additional messaging layer such as SOAP (simple object access protocol)

* REST-like => follows a loose adherence to REST

* Rack => middleware, provides a minimal inerface between webservers supporting Ruby and Ruby frameworks, an interface that can talk to a web server

* DSL => Domain Specific Language, DSL code only focuses on what you *want* the app to do, while the larger system figures out *how* to do it
